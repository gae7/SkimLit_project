omega-3 (n-3) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), vitamin D and overall diet\n","\n","METHODS:  We searched for meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCT's) of nutritional interventions during the perinatal period with PPD as an outcome, and checked for any trials published subsequently to the meta-analyses\n","\n","RESULTS:  Fish oil: Eleven RCT's of prenatal fish oil supplementation RCT's show null and positive effects on PPD symptoms\n","\n","RESULTS:  Vitamin D: no relevant RCT's were identified, however seven observational studies of maternal vitamin D levels with PPD outcomes showed inconsistent associations\n","\n","METHODS:  Diet: Two Australian RCT's with dietary advice interventions in pregnancy had a positive and null result on PPD\n","\n","RESULTS:  With the exception of fish oil, few RCT's with nutritional interventions during pregnancy assess PPD\n","\n","CONCLUSIONS:  Further research is needed to determine whether nutritional intervention strategies during pregnancy can protect against symptoms of PPD\n","\n","CONCLUSIONS:  Given the prevalence of PPD and ease of administering PPD measures, we recommend future prenatal nutritional RCT's include PPD as an outcome.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","BACKGROUND:  Mental illness, including depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder, accounts for a significant proportion of global disability and poses a substantial social, economic and heath burden\n","\n","BACKGROUND:  Treatment is presently dominated by pharmacotherapy, such as antidepressants, and psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy; however, such treatments avert less than half of the disease burden, suggesting that additional strategies are needed to prevent and treat mental disorders\n","\n","BACKGROUND:  There are now consistent mechanistic, observational and interventional data to suggest diet quality may be a modifiable risk factor for mental illness\n","\n","METHODS:  This review provides an overview of the nutritional psychiatry field\n","\n","METHODS:  It includes a discussion of the neurobiological mechanisms likely modulated by diet, the use of dietary and nutraceutical interventions in mental disorders, and recommendations for further research\n","\n","CONCLUSIONS:  Potential biological pathways related to mental disorders include inflammation, oxidative stress, the gut microbiome, epigenetic modifications and neuroplasticity\n","\n","CONCLUSIONS:  Consistent epidemiological evidence, particularly for depression, suggests an association between measures of diet quality and mental health, across multiple populations and age groups; these do not appear to be explained by other demographic, lifestyle factors or reverse causality\n","\n","CONCLUSIONS:  Our recently published intervention trial provides preliminary clinical evidence that dietary interventions in clinically diagnosed populations are feasible and can provide significant clinical benefit\n","\n","CONCLUSIONS:  Furthermore, nutraceuticals including n-3 fatty acids, folate, S-adenosylmethionine, N-acetyl cysteine and probiotics, among others, are promising avenues for future research\n","\n","CONCLUSIONS:  Continued research is now required to investigate the efficacy of intervention studies in large cohorts and within clinically relevant populations, particularly in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar and anxiety disorders.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","BACKGROUND:  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD), either alone or in combination, count for more than two thirds of all liver diseases in the Western world\n","\n","BACKGROUND:  There is no safe level of drinking in HCV-infected patients and the most effective goal for these patients is total abstinence\n","\n","BACKGROUND:  Baclofen, a GABA(B) receptor agonist, represents a promising pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence (AD)\n","\n","METHODS:  Previously, we performed a randomized clinical trial (RCT), which demonstrated the safety and efficacy of baclofen in patients affected by AD and cirrhosis\n","\n","METHODS:  The goal of this post-hoc analysis was to explore baclofen's effect in a subgroup of alcohol-dependent HCV-infected cirrhotic patients\n","\n","RESULTS:  Any patient with HCV infection was selected for this analysis\n","\n","RESULTS:  Among the 84 subjects randomized in the main trial, 24 alcohol-dependent cirrhotic patients had a HCV infection;
